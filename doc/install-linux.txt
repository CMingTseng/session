Installing Session on Linux or other UNIX-like systems

Session has a couple of dependencies which need to be available on the system
on which you want to run the main "session" command. Session supports Windows, 
Mac OS X and Linux as a client platform and these platforms have varying 
dependencies for session. In the instructions below, we will describe the 
installation steps and dependencies for the Linux and other UNIX-like platforms. 
If you follow these steps, you should have no troubles with running session!

NOTE! On the website (http://www.raaftech.nl/session) we've also listed the
dependencies described below, with links to where to get them! Make sure to
check it out!

1: Make sure you have a reasonably up to date Linux or UNIX like system.
   We've tested session with Fedora 12 and 13, with Ubuntu 8.04 and 10.04 and
   with small modifications, also on RHEL/CentOS 5 systems.

2: Session's access command opens tabs within gnome-terminal when something has
   an ssh access method. Make sure you have gnome-terminal installed! Also, to
   control gnome-terminal, we use wmctrl and xdotool. Make sure you have these
   commands installed also!

3: To test for open ports on a system when determining a system's state, the
   program uses nmap. Make sure you have nmap installed.

4: When session accesses systems which have an rdp access method, it uses the
   rdesktop command to facilitate the connection. Make sure you have rdesktop
   installed on your system.

5: The session command functionality, when talking to a windows box, uses the
   winexe program to do so. The winexe command is the equivalent of psexec on 
   windows platforms. Make sure you have winexe installed!

6: The session send functionality, when talking to a windows box, uses the
   smbclient program to do so. Make sure you have the smbclient command 
   installed on your system.

7: Install the session command somewhere in your path, like /usr/local/bin or
   anywhere else you prefer. You are now ready to run session for the first
   time!

8: Type 'session' at the command prompt. The session command will detect that
   it's being run for the first time and will do a search for all its needed
   dependencies. Next to that, it will create a default ~/.session directory
   layout with an empty session.conf (under ~/.session/cfg/session.conf).

9: Copy the template files in the distibution archive's 'tpl' directory to
   your personal template directory under ~/.session/tpl . These files use 
   the .stf (session template file) extention.


If session did not give an error about not being able to find any of its 
dependencies, the above run of the session command will show you the standard
help output. You are now ready to add systems to your session.conf! You can
use the "session addconf" and "session delconf" commands to do so (see the
standard session help output for addconf and delconf examples). Ofcourse, you
can also edit the ~/.session/cfg/session.conf file directly.
