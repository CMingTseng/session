* Known issue 1: PsExec and Windows Vista or Windows 7:
If you want to use the command, start and stop session commands to control a
remote Windows Vista or Windows 7 system, you need to run the following two
commands on that system first (run from a console with elevated/administrator
privileges, on one line):

reg delete "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy

reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 1


* Known Issue 2: Make sure regular user is logged in when using vmw vrmt:
When you're commanding Windows systems which have VMware Workstation as its
virtualization software, make sure that the user you're usually running VMware
as is logged into the system, all the way to a visible desktop. We've seen
issues where the vmrun command does not correctly list and start virtual
machines if the login screen is currently visible on the console. The regular
user mentioned above should also be the user you've defined as the "user" in
the session line decribing your host.


* Known Issue 3: When trying to use session send from a unix-like machine to
a remote Windows Vista or Windows 7 system, the smbclient command is used. 
When the remote Windows Vista or Windows 7 system has "Windows Live ID Sign-In
Assistant" installed, the smbclient command will fail. Make sure you uninstall
the "Windows Live ID Sign-In Assistant" from the remote system you want to 
use as a target with session send. For more information:
