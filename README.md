=======
Session is a utility that helps managing many computer systems. It handles the grouping, command execution, starting and stopping of systems and services.

Session allows you to group your systems together, store how you start and stop services in your landscape (and in what specific order) and actually start and stop your computers and services in stateful, serial or parallel mode.
