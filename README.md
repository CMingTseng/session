=======
Session is the state control component of OpenPCF. It handles the grouping, command execution, starting and stopping of systems and services.

Session allows you to group your systems together, store how you start and stop services in your landscape (and in what specific order) and actually start and stop your computers and services in stateful, serial or parallel mode.

Session makes it possible for OpenPCF to seamlessly and without agents talk to all hosts, guests and services within your landscape.
