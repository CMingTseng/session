* Known issue 1: PsExec and Windows Vista or Windows 7:

If you want to use the command, start and stop session commands to control a
remote Windows Vista or Windows 7 system, you need to run the following two
commands on that system first

> reg delete "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy
> reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 1

You need to run these commands in a console with elevated/administrator
privileges.  To get a console with sufficient privileges you may have to
click on the Windows icon, type "cmd" and then hit CTRL-SHIFT-ENTER.


* Known Issue 2: Make sure regular user is logged in when using vmw vrmt:

When you're commanding a Windows system with VMware Workstation running on it,
make sure that the user that runs VMware Workstation is logged into the
system all the way to a visible desktop. We've seen issues where the vmrun
command does not correctly list and start virtual machines if the login screen
is currently visible on the console. The regular user mentioned above should
also be the user you've defined as the "user" in the session line decribing
your host.


* Known Issue 3: Windows Live ID Sign-In Assistant conflicts with smbclient:

When trying to use session send from a unix-like machine to a remote Windows 
Vista or Windows 7 system, the smbclient command is used. 
When the remote Windows Vista or Windows 7 system has "Windows Live ID Sign-In
Assistant" installed, the smbclient command will fail. Make sure you uninstall
the "Windows Live ID Sign-In Assistant" from the remote system you want to 
use as a target with session send. For more information:

* Known Issue 4: Windows Vista and Windows 7 UAC one-time UAC pop-up for nmap:

When using session on a Windows Vista or Windows 7 machine, you might encounter
a UAC pop-up the first time session invokes a state check.
This will fail the first state check but all subsequent state checks will work
for as long as the logon session remains active. This happens because nmap 
requests elevated privileges. 

* Known Issue 5: Windows XP updates change default sharing security and psexec:

Updates released after Windows XP SP2 change the default sharing security
model for local accounts. The updates to Windows XP now sets this security 
option to "Guest only – local users authenticate as Guest". This denies the 
ability to implicitly or explicitly use of a specific user name/password
combination when interacting with the machine remotely using smb/cifs.
To fix, you have to set the "Network Access: Sharing and security model for 
local accounts" to "Classic – local users authenticate as themselves".
Access it via Start > Run > secpol.msc > Local Policies > Security Options,
and change "Network Access: Sharing and security model for local accounts" 
to "Classic - local users authenticate as themselves". For more information:

* Known Issue 6: winexe fails with "Failed to install... code 0x00000424"

The full message is:

to winexe 0.90 fixed it.


* Known Issue 7: winexe fails with command containing pipe character ('|')

Winexe prior to 1.00 does not allow the use of pipes in Windows commands.
Solution: upgrade to winexe 1.00.
